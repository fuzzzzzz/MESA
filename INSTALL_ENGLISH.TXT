2. Open the downloaded archive file with a program like WinRAR, 7-zip or winZip.
You must extract the Mesa directory where you want on your hard drive.
For example: C :/ MESA /


3. Once Mesa is decompressed on your hard drive, go to the directory "CONFIG".
Made a right click with your mouse on the file MESA_CONFIG.BAT because we will edit (modify) the file
to define some information about the location of Steam and the Source SDK tool engine.


Note: The "MESA_CONFIG.BAT.BAK" file is a copy of MESA_CONFIG.BAT, the file is read-only
to prevent possible mishandling.


The definition of the path to "STEAMDIR" is a bit special, the access path must be defined to include a "quote at the beginning but not at the end.
Also it is important that the paths do not contain any white space at the end of the defined path.
