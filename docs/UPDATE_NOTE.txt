Update mesa Version
--------------------------------

the easier and the safer way to update from mesa  2.0.1 to  2.1

1. go at the location of the MESA installation directory
2. rename the folder from c:/MESA to c:/MESA_201
3. extract mesa 2.1 on your drive it could be that: "c:/MESA"

4. go to c:/mesa_201/projects/ and accordingly to the context follow the sub sections :

a. you are using a project workspace that is shipped by default with mesa
b. you have created a custom project workspace for your mod project


A. Default projects workspace
example for source filmmaker :
1. open the c:/mesa201/projects/sourcefilmmaker/
2. copy modelsrc, materialsrc and scenes directories, to c:/mesa/projects/sourcefilmmaker/
3. you can now, edit the mesa/mesa_config.bat and execute the batch file  with run as administrator.
4. run as administrator the batch : c:/mesa/projects/sourcefilmmaker/source_filmmaker.bat
5. run maya, and set the project to c:/mesa/projects/sourcefilmmaker/
6. enjoy ;)

B. Custom projects workspace

the most easiest thing you could do is to apply the change i made to the batch file at the root of your project workspace.

Now test out the new version and if there is no special issue with this version, you can delete c:/MESA_201/
